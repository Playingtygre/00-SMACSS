##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?
The way that I determined which files needed to be places in the css was by using the SMACCS naming convention. Base.css has all the base body, paragraph stuff inside of it. Layout.css has all the aside css, header footer css and everything else. Modules.css has all the other widgets and dialog inside of them.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

Possibly, not really. I dont want to refractor any code because css is really tricky sometimes. If I make a certain selector ahead of another I might end up displacing another code base.
